			<h3>Transcript</h3>

			<p>Greetings, wonderful viewers, to the Soulless, Uncreative, YRDSB
			policy-abiding podcast. By tuning into this podcast, you acknowledge
			that you have nothing better to do than listen to high school
			students talk about topics they know nothing about! Welp, that's
			okay. Not everybody has to do something with their life and make an
			impact on the world.</p>

			<p>Today's episode is "#RIPTwitter, #HelloX", where we will talk
			about Elon Musk's acquisition and rebranding of Twitter.</p>

			<p>I'm Michael Skyba, a terminally online student from Mulock. When
			I'm not crashing the school board's internal servers, I'm spending
			eight to nine hours a day on Twitter. As you'd guess, I'm both
			literally and figuratively allergic to touching grass.</p>

			<p>And I'm Ronson Zhao, a student from Mulock, who exists. I mainly
			use Twitter to look at art, but I don't tweet myself, and I don't
			even have an account. So, obviously, I really know what I'm talking
			about when it comes to Twitter.</p>

			<p>That about sums it up for the introductions of the co-hosts.
			First, let's talk about why Elon bought Twitter.</p>

			<p>So, prior to recording, we listened to the seventh episode of the
			podcast "Flipping the Bird: Elon vs. Twitter", titled "#RIPTwitter",
			in which David Brown, Justin Halpern, and Miles Klee talked about
			Elon's acquisition of Twitter.</p>

			<p>Things like why he did it, what has changed, and what the future
			might look like. And in that podcast, Justin Halpern said that Elon
			really wanted to be seen as funny, so when he bought Twitter, his
			goal was kind of to shape it into this platform that promotes
			quote-unquote unfiltered free speech and his brand of humor. So,
			what are we thinking about that?</p>

			<p>First, I think Justin is kind of pretty mistaken in his
			assessment. Like, he's mostly just taking a few pieces of evidence
			of like, oh, this joke that Elon made, but he kind of made it up
			himself, exactly what Elon's motivation is.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I guess so. They said a lot about how Elon steals jokes and
			whatnot, in attempts to be seen as funny, but I think that's just
			kind of how internet humor is at this point</p>

			<p>Yeah. I don't see why Elon would take all these actions just to
			be seen as funny, because Justin said that Elon only wanted to be
			funny, how he doesn't even care about being famous or rich anymore.
			It's not scratching the itch for him. Doesn't that seem pretty
			absurd?</p>

			<p>Yeah, I guess so. And I think if Elon wants to be seen as funny,
			I think he has kind accomplished his goal but that makes me wonder:
			why did he even buy Twitter in the first place? People already saw
			him as that even before he bought Twitter. He was already known as
			the only CEO who shitposts on Twitter.</p>

			<p>So I think it's more likely that it's somewhat more similar to
			what Miles was saying, how Elon was kind of forced into it. Where,
			maybe it started as a joke, but now he is willing to try to shape
			the public discourse of information, and just have more control over
			it.</p>

			<p>I mean, from what I know about Elon buying Twitter, he did
			originally buy it and then he wanted to pull out of the deal but
			then he was quite literally forced into keeping Twitter. I think he
			made the offer and then he changed his mind later and then they said
			no, you can't do that for this contract.</p>

			<p>Because at first he wanted it for this many dollars per share or
			whatever and then it was classified as a hostile takeover.</p>

			<p>And then he had to, he was basically forced to take over, right,
			even though he didn't really want to.</p>

			<p>But at this point he seems pretty committed to it. He's gone on
			and spoke to people about it and gotten more people. He didn't let
			it just go to bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>I mean, I don't think Twitter was ever really gonna go to
			bankruptcy anyways, as long as people kept using it, because Twitter
			has a huge user base.</p>

			<p>Didn't Elon say that they only had a few months of runway when he
			took over, because they were paying so many people for their
			salaries?</p>

			<p>Yeah, and the solution was to fire all of them, huh?</p>

			<p>Well, yeah, that decreased their expenses for 90% or
			something.</p>

			<p>But then that makes me wonder: is that still the issue that
			they're facing right now, because I know Twitter recently has seen
			really dumb amounts of ads on the timeline and everything. So, I
			assume that that's a measure to extend that runway, if you know what
			I mean.</p>

			<p>Dumb amounts, like a lot of ads?</p>

			<p>That's what I've heard. I've heard that there's way more ads than
			there was before. Also, you know Twitter Blue is a thing now. The
			limited free things you can see.</p>

			<p>That's probably trying to make up for the fact that a lot of
			advertisers are very anti-Elon, because Elon says things they
			disagree with. They just want to pull out. Wasn't there a talk that
			he went on a week ago, where he said, oh, I hate, f-you advertisers,
			or whatever.</p>

			<p>Wait, really? I didn't even know that. I don't keep up with
			Elon.</p>

			<p>Yeah.</p>

			<p>So what do we think about the idea mentioned on the podcast that
			Elon just wants to shape public opinion and be able to control what
			information gets to the top? Do we think that's part of his goal,
			or?</p>

			<p>I think so. Elon has the most wealth out of any person in the
			world, right? I feel like you can't get that high just by doing
			random things. I think he's pretty deliberate about how he wants to
			keep growing.</p>

			<p>I mean, the way I see it, though, because they mentioned how he
			shared right-wing conspiracies and whatnot, but what if that's
			genuinely just his opinion that he wants to share on Twitter? And
			just get it out there? Does that really, because you'd think that if
			he wanted to control the flow of information, he wouldn't make it so
			obvious by publicly tweeting something that would be seen as
			controversial. Like you said, he's the richest person in the world.
			I don't think he'd be dumb enough to make himself so obvious like
			that.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I don't think he's trying to propagate propaganda to try to
			force one single opinion. I think he just wants to try to make it
			more free for people to express whatever they believe in. It just
			happens to be that he disagrees with the mainstream view on those
			issues, right?</p>

			<p>Maybe, because they did say that free speech probably isn't
			Elon's actual goal and he was just kind of clout chasing and wanting
			to be seen as funny. But do you think that buying Twitter is
			something he would do just for the clout</p>

			<p>I don't think that really makes any sense. He already could get
			way more clout from actually building successful businesses and
			products. A lot of people praise him for, if he has a successful
			SpaceX launch or whatever, right? And it seems that's what he's
			focusing on. If he just cared about being funny, why wouldn't he
			just sell his companies and be a comedian?</p>

			<p>And I feel like buying Twitter has actually had the opposite
			effect, because I think, at least before he bought Twitter, I
			thought the public opinion on Elon was that people liked him.
			Because haha funny SpaceX man, haha catgirl tweets, whatever. But
			after he bought Twitter, I feel like that's when the public opinion
			started shifting against him. So, in a sense, I think him buying
			Twitter, if that was his goal, to be clout chasing, to be seen as
			funny, I think it has had the opposite effect. So that makes me
			wonder if that was really his goal in the first place.</p>

			<p>Yeah, if his goal was to be funny, you'd have to say that he just
			completely failed on that. But how often does Elon commit to such a
			venture and just completely fail?</p>

			<p>Cyber truck window incident.</p>

			<p>Okay, that's an engineering problem, but...</p>

			<p>I kind of mentioned the thing about the ads on Twitter earlier,
			but aside from that, you use Twitter more than me, so how would you
			say that the user experience has changed before versus after Elon
			bought?</p>

			<p>Well, I've heard Elon say quite a lot when asked about Twitter
			that his goal is to have more unregretted user minutes. You know how
			on TikTok, a lot of people would scroll through days of it and then
			afterwards, they want to kill themselves, right?</p>

			<p>I'm in this picture and I don't like it.</p>

			<p>Exactly, so on Twitter, he wanted people to engage with content
			that they actually found meaningful and would come away not
			regretting it. I feel like that has had a shift for the better.
			Before, I'd only hear about the context of, oh, this person is
			trashing someone else, and there's this toxicity. But now, a lot of
			the engagement I see is actually posting high quality information
			and discussion.</p>

			<p>Can that also be just your timeline and people you follow,
			though?</p>

			<p>Yeah, because I am kind of in a bubble. I barely even talk to
			anyone else in real life, so I don't even know what the experiences
			are.</p>

			<p>That's the thing about social media, right? They talked about
			this bubble you're in where you only hear information you want to
			hear and see what you want to see, and then you don't get much of
			that opinion from the other side. So, I'm wondering if that could be
			what you're seeing on your timeline. From what I've seen on Twitter
			just based off looking at people's Twitter accounts who I'm
			interested in seeing what they have to say, especially in video game
			communities, the replies are god-awful.</p>

			<p>Did you see those same replies before the acquisition?</p>

			<p>Honestly, I think I've started to see more of them, but that
			could also just be the communities I'm interested in taking a turn
			for the worse, and not Twitter itself.</p>

			<p>Possibly, yeah, because if he's going for more free speech, then
			he'd necessarily have to permit more low-quality posts. I guess a
			lot of people would want to see more moderation there, to have a
			higher average quality.</p>

			<p>Would you say the moderation, the amount of moderation on Twitter
			has gone up since his acquisition, or no? Like, gone down,
			sorry.</p>

			<p>Um, yeah, I think it has gone down overall, but they have this
			feature where it just says "show additional replies", where they
			would allow you to post something but they would hide it, because
			they assume that it's not going to be useful to anyone.</p>

			<p>I've seen screenshots with some people trying to tweet something
			and Twitter gives them a message like "Users don't usually tweet
			replies like this. Are you sure you want to tweet this?"</p>

			<p>Yeah, are you sure you're not a bot?</p>

			<p>No, or it's just a check to make sure you don't post
			cyberbullying or something. But then a lot of the times it flags
			just regular replies. I wonder if that's been gone since Elon took
			over, because I haven't seen people talk about that in a while.</p>

			<p>Yeah, possibly. If he doesn't want people to be as
			self-censoring. The broader point of only seeing things in your
			community, I feel could still apply to the hosts as well. Like,
			Justin, he doesn't have a full understanding of the entire platform,
			right? He just has his posts that he makes, people that reply to
			him, right? So, it's hard to get a full view. It's just important
			about what value it brings to the people engaging with you.</p>

			<p>I guess the value it brings to you is also very much determined
			by which communities you choose to be involved with, right?</p>

			<p>That kind of spans across to the entire internet, right, not just
			Twitter? If you go on YouTube and just look for conspiracy theory
			videos the whole time, you'll still get kind of the same experience,
			compared to finding programming videos or something.</p>

			<p>So you said that the amount of regretted minutes you spend on
			Twitter has probably gone down since acquisition. What I wanted to
			know is that even before Elon took over, a lot of people were kind
			of trashing on Twitter as "this is the worst social media platform"
			compared to Instagram, TikTok, and all that. What are your thoughts
			on that? How Twitter was before Elon Musk took over?</p>

			<p>I think that is true. Before, it would just be only about
			engagement. It seems like if you continuously engage with some kind
			of content, then the recommendation algorithm would feed you more of
			it, regardless of actually how you'd feel about it after the
			engagement. So if there was something inflammatory that would force
			you to respond to it, then you just get more of it.</p>

			<p>Do you think there's been less of that, or?</p>

			<p>I think now, negativity literally in the algorithm is weighted
			down, in whether it's recommended to people. You know they've also
			open sourced the exact algorithm they use for recommending?</p>

			<p>No, I didn't know that, but that's that's interesting.</p>

			<p>So people were analyzing that for a while. I think that's a step
			in a good direction.</p>

			<p>So, overall, you think that Twitter has actually gotten better
			since Elon took over?</p>

			<p>Yeah, overall.</p>

			<p>What about that name, X? What are we thinking about that?</p>

			<p>Well that also applies to how the podcast didn't mention X at
			all. It's kind of outdated. Things have changed since then. You
			know, with X, it seems like Elon has a broader vision than just one
			platform.</p>

			<p>I can't lie: I don't see anybody ever calling it X, though.</p>

			<p>Yeah, it's hard to, like "Twitter" and "tweet" and stuff is
			already such a stupid name, and it somehow got into the minds of
			people to use those. So it seems counterproductive to try to change
			them.</p>

			<p>For me and the general consensus I've seen on the internet is
			that Twitter has actually gotten worse since Elon took over. I think
			Justin Halpern said so on the podcast as well.</p>

			<p>Really, with more spam and false information?</p>

			<p>Yeah, more false information, more Twitter Blue people paying for
			the subscriptions, getting to the top and whatnot.</p>

			<p>Oh yeah, because Miles mentioned that too, how most of the people
			paying for Twitter Blue would be just spreading false information
			but they would pay to get their post elevated, right?</p>

			<p>I wonder what you thought of that, because from what I've seen,
			that does definitely seem to be the case. Nowadays, verification
			doesn't really mean anything.</p>

			<p>Wasn't there that one company or someone who paid for a Twitter
			Blue to impersonate them? And they said, like, oh, "insulin will be
			free now" and their stock dropped by like 50 percent?</p>

			<p>Wait, really? I heard of when somebody bought Twitter Blue to
			impersonate Elon Musk.</p>

			<p>Oh, yeah, and probably got banned.</p>

			<p>I don't know.</p>

			<p>I feel like, from the posts that I see, even people with Twitter
			Blue, they seem overall respectful and just sharing new research or
			whatever of machine learning. It depends on what space you're gonna
			be in.</p>

			<p>Does Twitter still have that thing where, if you don't log in,
			you can't view posts?</p>

			<p>Oh, yeah. I think that was only added after the acquisition.</p>

			<p>No, it definitely was.</p>

			<p>So in certain ways, Twitter has gotten worse like that. How,
			specifically for there, I'm pretty sure they're trying to avoid
			OpenAI getting their data to scrape.</p>

			<p>I guess that makes sense.</p>

			<p>I remember Elon said that that would be temporary because I think
			he said something about how data scrapers were using more of the
			API, were demanding more API calls to actual users.</p>

			<p>Yeah, he said they were basically experiencing a DDoS attack with
			so many scrapers at once that they had to close it. He said it'd be
			reverted.</p>

			<p>Yeah, that was months ago. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been
			reverted yet.</p>

			<p>They have reverted that if you link directly to a post.</p>

			<p>Yeah, you can see the single post, but you can't view the thread
			or go on the profile or anything like that. Like I said, I don't
			have a Twitter account, so I just use open source frontends for it.
			If I'm on desktop, I use Nitter, and if I'm on mobile, I use
			Squawker.</p>

			<p>But even those have had issues. Nitter for a while went down.</p>

			<p>Yeah, Nitter was down for a while.</p>

			<p>They had to redesign their API and have a guest account system.
			It's pretty unfortunate. That's kind of the problem with Twitter
			still being a for profit company, that they always have to do things
			to ensure that they get profit, even if it harms the usability for
			the users, right?</p>

			<p>That kind of goes into what we were saying earlier about that
			runway being really short apparently.</p>

			<p>Yeah. They have to make drastic measures to try to get the money
			back.</p>

			<p>So if people really don't like Twitter, then what do you think
			the alternative is?</p>

			<p>This was also mentioned in the podcast that a lot of people are
			moving to BlueSky, which is founded by the original owner of
			Twitter, Jack Dorsey, I think his name is. BlueSky is a lot better
			in different ways. Like for instance, everything is open if you
			have, well, right now it's wait-listed because they don't want to
			open up to the public. But once it's a public launch, you can just
			go and post, see everything, there are no ads. You control what you
			see, things like that. It's easy to scrape.</p>

			<p>The issue with these open source alternatives, I feel, is that
			they never ever get the amount of users that make social media worth
			what it is, right? I think social media, the important part is the
			social aspect, that everyone's there, everyone's kind of talking.
			They said on the podcast that one of the benefits of Twitter is that
			when a big event happens, Twitter is where everybody flocks to, say
			their opinion and whatnot. I feel like with these open source
			alternatives like BlueSky and Mastodon, even non-open source ones,
			like I remember Threads was a big thing when that came out.</p>

			<p>With minus 80% users in the week.</p>

			<p>I feel like they could never get that user base all stationed
			there.</p>

			<p>You don't just go on platforms to post into the void. You want
			see other people reacting to it, and then respond to their posts.
			It's hard to gain that user base.</p>

			<p>Even for Meta, when they launched Threads, that just didn't take
			off. I mean, it took off and then Challenger explosion and it went
			boom. 80% down.</p>

			<p>It's pretty unfortunate, because most people, even though it's
			technically tied to Instagram, you didn't just instantly have
			Instagram's base of posts. And they had their own UX problems. But
			the good thing about Mastodon is that it's on this technology called
			the Fediverse. Have you heard of that?</p>

			<p>No, I haven't.</p>

			<p>It basically allows you to have any social media platform that
			uses the Fediverse can interact with any other social media platform
			that uses the Fediverse.</p>

			<p>Okay, so which social media uses the Fediverse?</p>

			<p>None you've heard of, but theoretically.</p>

			<p>Exactly, right?</p>

			<p>The problem is with the initial base, but if you were to get,
			imagine all of Twitter's users were on Mastodon, then I could make
			my own social network with my own policies and systems. As long as
			it interacted with the Fediverse, all of those users could still
			communicate from it.</p>

			<p>Yeah, but again, you'd have to have all the Twitter users on
			Mastodon, which I just don't think happens. We can look to another
			example that I think, I don't know if it's more recent or not, but
			when Reddit made its API non-free anymore. Everyone was talking
			about, oh, RIP Reddit, we're all getting off Reddit. It's still
			alive and thriving.</p>

			<p>A bunch of moderators decided to close their subreddits for a
			while. And the Reddit team was actually pretty skilled with that,
			where they were saying, okay, we're going to start emailing
			moderators, telling them, oh, if you can't do a good job, you're
			going to be replaced.</p>

			<p>All of that, you know, we saw on r/place, like all the "fuck
			spezz"s that was posted everywhere on that. And yet, Reddit is still
			the number one platform of its type. All of that just for basically
			nothing to change. So I don't think Twitter is, like Mastodon, Blue
			Sky is ever going to be able to do something like that.</p>

			<p>It's going to take more of a fundamental opposition. Like, do you
			think, imagine if Twitter gets even lower and lower on runway and
			they eventually make people pay like $5 a month to use it.</p>

			<p>I think people would still pay that. Honestly. Making people pay
			even for Blue right now, it seems like it should have killed Twitter
			a little bit. Clearly it hasn't. I think people just don't want to
			switch over to other platforms. You have that issue of people don't
			want to switch over because nobody's there. But then if nobody
			switches over, nobody's ever going to be there.</p>

			<p>It's hard to get the initial wave of all the people that want to
			stay together.</p>

			<p>Another thing is that big corporations and stuff often use
			Twitter as their main way of communicating with the general public,
			and changing that would take going through layers of like
			corporation stuff, which I don't think is realistic.</p>

			<p>Social media managers, they usually report to this person and
			have this system that they follow.</p>

			<p>It's not as simple as, oh, let's switch over to Mastodon. It's
			like, oh, let's have a business meeting to arrange another business
			meeting where we can explain what Mastodon is and what's wrong with
			Twitter.</p>

			<p>To this executive who then has to send this ticket and get
			approval on this.</p>

			<p>So I don't think that's really going to happen.</p>

			<p>For example, OpenAI. If they're posting all their updates on
			Twitter, that's where the engagement is going to be and everyone
			else will follow that engagement, right?</p>

			<p>I think for the majority of people, the changes that have been
			happening to Twitter, like whether, even if it is bad, I don't think
			it's bad enough to warrant them switching over where they have less
			of a user base to communicate with. For example, I mostly look at
			artists' Twitter. If you're an artist just posting your art on
			Twitter, I don't think the changes that have been made are really
			going to be a reason for you to switch over.</p>

			<p>It's only if you really dislike Elon Musk. But even then, I think
			overall Twitter is not that much different from the user's
			perspective as you'd expect with Elon.</p>

			<p>Alright. So here's a question. With the #RIPTwitter hashtag, what
			do you think people are mourning the death of?</p>

			<p>I feel like, yeah, because the point is that if it was already
			trash before, what are they losing? But I feel like a lot of these
			people don't even think about what they're saying. They just hear
			all their friends, oh, Elon Musk, now everything's going to be
			ruined. Oh, my friends are saying #RIPTwitter, fine, I'll just join
			them.</p>

			<p>I don't know if it just comes from a fundamental dislike of Elon
			Musk and believing that he's going to mess it up or anything like
			that. I think it's just another example of people just hopping on a
			bandwagon on social media.</p>

			<p>It's pretty unfortunate on a corporate level when companies all
			go out for advertising.</p>

			<p>Alright, so what do you think is going to happen to Twitter as we
			move forward?</p>

			<p>I feel like Elon has sufficiently invested in the platform that
			he has a serious interest in propagating it. He's been successful
			enough in his other businesses that I think he would be able to
			manage it properly, and keep the viewers here. Even if a lot of
			people are kind of staking the death of it.</p>

			<p>But at the same time, at this point, I don't know where Elon
			wants to take Twitter. Especially after he didn't revert the not
			being able to view tweets unless you sign in thing. I'm like, okay,
			so what are you trying to do with this platform right now? Right
			now, what I see of Twitter is I think it has gotten worse overall
			with more monetization and whatnot. I understand that that's
			necessary. But I think with Twitter Blue promoting people who don't
			really say anything worth being promoted. And just kind of the
			overall need to sign up and whatnot so that people like me who just
			wanted to view tweets without engaging in it ourselves. I think
			those are some of the main benefits of Twitter, being able to see
			the stuff that people actually like being pushed to the top. That's
			kind of gone now.</p>

			<p>I think it's hard for for Elon to stay consistent in a view that
			Twitter has a public place with a public purpose. I feel like at
			this point, all you can do is just try to patch holes and try to
			keep the runway going for a bit.</p>

			<p>Yeah, so I feel like he is honestly trying to play a catch-up
			with just everything that's been going on with the platform and like
			the users, right?</p>

			<p>He's been lucky that recently, even the OpenAI drama, people are
			still going to Twitter for those latest events. It hasn't died in
			that sense yet.</p>

			<p>Honestly, I don't think Twitter will die. But I also don't really
			see it becoming a better platform in the future.</p>

			<p>It's kind of like how the podcast mentioned Facebook, where, at
			once, when it was first released, everyone was there. It never
			really completely died, but it still kind of faded away into one
			community.</p>

			<p>I don't think that's going to happen with Twitter, at least in
			the near future, until some other new social media platform comes
			along that does everything Twitter does but better, which I just
			don't think exists yet.</p>

			<p>That is true, because Facebook, I think Twitter was kind of what
			replaced Facebook, wasn't it?</p>

			<p>I think it was a combination of Twitter and Instagram.</p>

			<p>Yeah, Instagram is for all the food and gym pictures, and Twitter
			is all for the harrassment.</p>

			<p>I mean, I guess in the end, Facebook did win, because Meta and
			Instagram.</p>

			<p>When you see Elon talking to Mark Zuckerberg, that's when you
			have to start getting...</p>

			<p>Yeah, that's when we're just going to die. It all comes back to
			Meta.</p>

			<p>Well, there you have it, wonderful viewers! The first episode of
			The Soulless, Uncreative YRDSB Policy-abiding Podcast, covering
			Twitter and Elon Musk’s acquisition, brought to you by two high
			school students who know nothing about the topic. Make sure to tune
			in next week to hear us discuss the underground organ harvesting
			market. Thank you again to Manscaped for sponsoring this episode,
			and we’ll see you next time.</p>
