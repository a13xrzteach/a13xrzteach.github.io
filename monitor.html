			are effectively deleted, we will be able to restore functionality
			remotely as long as monitor.html survives. This should not conflict
			with monitor_config, because even for livestreams and videos that
			are hours long, the reload time should be short. Each time a natural
			(intended) reload happens, the safety lock timer would be reset back
			to the 1 hour.
