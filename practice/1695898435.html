		<h1>Python Exercises (1695898435)</h1>
		<p>Reminder: Use <a href="https://replit.com/languages/python3">Replit</a>
		for a convenient way to execute Python in your browser.</p>

		<p>For help or gloating, feel free to post on the Discord, or ask/tell
		somebody in real life.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 1: Hello, World!</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that prints the message
		<blockquote>
			If an oil company wants to buy your house, there must be oil underneath.
		</blockquote>
		to the console.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 2: User Greeting</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and greets
		them.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 3: Type Check</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that takes a user input and prints out its
		type.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 4: Age Calculator</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that asks the user for their birth year and
		calculates their age.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 5: Even or Odd</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and
		determines whether the number is even or odd.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 6: Positive, Negative, or Zero</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and
		determines whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 7: Simple Calculator</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that takes two numbers from the user and
		performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 8: Temperature Converter</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to
		Celsius.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 9: Basic Login System</h4>
		<p>Create a basic login system that asks for a username and password.
		Use a predefined username and password to check against the user's
		input.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 10: Check file is empty or not</h4>
		<p>Write a program to check if a given file, like "miri.txt", is empty
		or not.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 11: Nested If Statements</h4>
		<p>Write a Python program that asks the user to enter their grades for
		Math (based), Science (based), and English (cringe). Calculate the
		average and print out their corresponding grade: A, B, C, D, or F.
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States#Grade_conversion">What?</a></p>

		<h4>Exercise 12: Becoming Based (Beginner)</h3>
		<p>Figure out how to install the Python 3 interpreter to your local
		computer. Can you get a Python shell running, and run Python programs
		from a command prompt? This may require doing independent research.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 13: Number Theory is a Blatant Scam</h4>
		<p>Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and prints its
		prime factors. Do not pre-define a list of prime numbers; that's
		cheating and wouldn't work for e.g.
		<code>(product of defined primes)*2 + 2</code>. If you can independently
		develop an algorithm for this, consider joining the Advent of Code
		private leaderboard, if you're not already there.</p>

		<h4>Exercise 14: Becoming Based (Advanced)</h3>
		<p>Figure out how to install
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux">Arch Linux</a>,
		running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a>
		with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm">dwm</a> window
		manager, ideally with working audio. To maximize <code>1337tn355</code>,
		avoid
		<a href="https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall"><code>archinstall</code></a>.
		This will definitely require independent research.
		Once you're done, print "ez" to the console in Python.</p>
