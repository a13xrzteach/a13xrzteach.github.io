The monitor view is located at https://a13xrzteach.github.io/monitor.html.

## Slide Cycling
Right now, the monitor view cycles through images.

To modify the cycle, add your images to the
[cycle_images/ folder](https://github.com/a13xrzteach/a13xrzteach.github.io/tree/main/cycle_images).
Then, modify
[monitor_config.js](https://github.com/a13xrzteach/a13xrzteach.github.io/blob/main/monitor_config.js).
After a few minutes (although this will depend on how long you set your images
to be shown for), the monitor should update without requiring direct access.
